/*
basic logial operators
not specific to just JS

"AND" operator 
"TRUE" when all the variables are TRUE
"OR" determines if its "TRUE" only if one operator is TRUE
"NOT" operator acts on only one boolean value

example:
    age = 16
    Age is >= 20 (false)
    Age is <= 30 (true)
    
    !A is True
    A and B false 
    A OR B True
    !A AND B True
    A OR !B false
